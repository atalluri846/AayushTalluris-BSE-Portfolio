# A Robot That Uses Computer Vision To Track A Ball
This will serve as a brief description of your project. Limit this to three sentences because it can become overly long at that point. This copy should draw the user in and make she/him want to read more.

# Final Milestone
My final milestone is the increased reliability and accuracy of my robot. I ameliorated the sagging and fixed the reliability of the finger. As discussed in my second milestone, the arm sags because of weight. I put in a block of wood at the base to hold up the upper arm; this has reverberating positive effects throughout the arm. I also realized that the forearm was getting disconnected from the elbow servo’s horn because of the weight stress on the joint. Now, I make sure to constantly tighten the screws at that joint.

# First Milestone
  

My first milestone was setting up and hooking up the Raspberry Pi 3 and the l298n Motor Driver to the Smart Car Chassis. First, I setup the Raspberry Pi 3 by downloading the Raspberry Pi OS (Raspbian) onto a MicroSD card using a Raspberry Pi Imager on my PC.  Afterwards, I built the Smart Car Chassis which set the base model for my robot. After I finished the Smart Car Chassis, I wired up the l298n motor driver to the 4 DC motors, attatched the battery pack, and the Raspberry Pi 3 GPIO to the motor driver using some jumper wire. I then started coding for the Motor driver by first making shadow code on my computer using Microsoft Visual Studio in Python. Afterwards, I would transfer the code to Github and copy onto the Pi. Originally, I made some test code to make sure that the DC motors and l298n Motor Driver were wired and working correctly. Afterwards, I imporved my test code and the robot was now able to move forward and backward and able to turn left and right. Since there were four motors I needed to use a tank drive in order to accomplish this. Finally, I made my code run on the Raspberry Pi upon startup which made it easier to run the code as before I needed to plug my Raspberry Pi into the monitor just to start the code.

One of the main challenges I faced was making sure that everything would fit on the Smart Car Chassis. The Motor Driver, the 2 Battery Packs(One for the Raspberry Pi and one for the Motor Driver), and the Raspberry Pi were all pretty large and finding a way to put them all in the chassis took a very long time. Eventurally I found a way in which it all fitted together.

Next week I plan on adding the Ultrasonic Sensor and the Camera Module to detect the Ball and have the robot move towards the Ball. To accomplish this I will be using OpenCv to detect the color and the general location of the ball.
